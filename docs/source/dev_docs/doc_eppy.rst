Documenting eppy
================

If you want to contribute to the Eppy documentation, you'll need to jump through a few hoops. Why? If it were simple, it wouldn't be fun.

If your documentation uses code examples to clarify your addition, it's best to start in the iPython notebook. This is because you can actually run the code and make sure your examples are correct. Then you will have to convert your iPython notebook to restructured text. After that, Sphinx will generate the HTML file. I'll walk you through this in the following sections.

If you don't need to use code to explain yourself, you can simply write documentation in restructured text, and then use Sphinx to generate an HTML file. For example, this text was written directly into a restructured text document and the converted to an HTML file with Sphinx.

This documentation is incomplete.
